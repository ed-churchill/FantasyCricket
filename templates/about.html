            <h3>How Fantasy Cricket works</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Each player in UWMCC gets assigned a <b>role</b> (Batsman, Bowler, Wicket-Keeper or All-Rounder), a <b>squad</b> (1s/2s, 3s/4s or Dev), and a <b>price</b>.</li>
                <li> 
                    UWMCC members can then choose their Fantasy Team, subject to the following restraints. Each team must:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Cost <b>no more than Â£100 million</b></li>
                        <li> Contain <b>exactly 4 batsmen</b> (Wicket-keepers can also be picked as a batsman)</li>
                        <li> Contain <b>exactly 3 all-rounders</b></li>
                        <li> Contain <b>at least 1 wicket-keeper</b>(additional keepers can be picked as batsmen</li>
                        <li> Contain <b>exactly 3 bowlers</b></li>
                        <li> Contain <b>no more than 6 players from the same squad</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> BUCS matches are played each week, where players can pick up <b>points</b> for batting, bowling and fielding. 
                    A team's points is the sum of all of its individuals' points. The points are CALCULATED as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>This line is to test GitHub integration with Heroku</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                
            </ol>
